# MERGE SORT ALGORITHM IN PYTHON
# -[https://github.com//anshika0207]

A list can be sorted using various algorithms, one of which is Merge sort.
The algorithm is based on the idea of dividing and conquer rule.
The list is sorted until it reaches a point where exactly one element in a list is left.
This process is done recursively until we obtain a sorted list.


Merge Sort algorithm Steps-

Step 1: Check if the list contains more than one items; if yes, divide the list into two halves, else the list is sorted

Step 2: The list is to be divided repeatedly until there is only a single element left in each sub-list

Step 3: Recursively merge the sub-lists by arranging them in the given order until you get a single sorted list
